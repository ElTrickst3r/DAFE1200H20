<div class="problem">

  <h2>Children can't study!</h2>

  <p>
    More than 1.6 billion children lost access
    to education in early April 2020 due to the corona virus outbreak.
    Before the virus, there were over 258 million children out of school.
    This is the first time in history where an entire generation had their
    education interrupted. Children missing out on education has great consequences,
    both short term, and long term.
  </p>

  <p>
    Save The Children fear most children will not return to school after the covid-19 crisis
    and they do not have good enough data to analyze why children are out of school or which
    children will not attend their classes again. To identify and monitor students missing out
    on education, we want to create a system to monitor the attendance and absence of children
    in developing countries.

<div class="solution">

  <h2>How do we solve this?</h2>

  <p>
    AI<span>DE</span> aims to solve this issue by collecting large amounts of data on the
    attendance of students. This data will be digitalized and sent to our AI<span>DE</span>
    global database, where the data will be analyzed by our advanced artificial intelligence.
    Our AI takes multiple factors into account such as the region, health, gender,
    travel distance and more. This ensures we get accurate information on why students are not
    attending school.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes our solution unique is how our advanced AI can also tailor specific solutions
    for different regions and sending these to Save the Children. The AI will also be able
    to pick up on outliers. For example, if it finds reports of high attendance in a region
    where all factors indicate otherwise.

<div class="collect">

  <h2>How do we collect data?</h2>

  <p>
    We aim to make it easy to collect data by introducing a simple solution for use in developing
    countries. Every school will give out an AI<span>DE</span>-form to every student which logs
    their attendance, health, travel distance and so on. Simultaneously, the teachers will record
    their studentsâ€™ attendance each day to limit falsified data.
  </p>

  <p>
    The school administration will be held responsible to collect, digitize and send the data
    to the AI<span>DE</span> database. The AI<span>DE</span>-forms needs to be collected each semester
    and attendance needs to be updated each month.
  </p>

<div class="team">

  <h2>About us</h2>

  <p>
    AI<span>DE</span> was built by a group of 15 students from the Oslo Metropolitan University.
    We were assigned this case by Save the Children and worked together as a team to find an
    advanced solution but simple to use in developing countries. Our team consists of people
    with experience within multiple industries and diverse backgrounds which we believe is
    a recipe for success. We aspire to bring education to everyone, and we believe our solution
    could be the way to achieve this in many, if not all, developing countries.
